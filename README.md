# apache-releases-client

This is a command line client for the Apache Trusted Releases (ATR) platform, utilising the ATR API to perform actions. The ATR provides Apache Software Foundation (ASF) participants with an easy way to make software releases. The goal of this client is to make things even easier, especially for those who prefer CLI or TUI workflows.

This project is maintained by ASF Tooling. As of July 2025, we have only just started work on this client, so there isn't anything to test yet. As we add functionality, we'll update this README. We will be focusing on the CLI first of all, keeping the TUI as a long term goal.

Please feedback to the ASF Tooling mailing list, or the `#apache-trusted-releases` Slack. We welcome contributions already, and you may file issues or create pull requests. To assist us in reviewing your code, please adhere to our style guidelines as noted in the codebase. Thank you.

The ATR API is not stable, so please do not rely on its schema. The client CLI is also not stable, so please do not use it in unattended scripts.
